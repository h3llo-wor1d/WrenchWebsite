                    Commonly Asked Project Muse Questions

                    Q: What Is Project Muse?<br>
                    A: Project Muse is a unique live show in which VTubers are randomly picked, 
                    interviewed, and made custom BGM for live, on my stream, using a unique Discord bot I programmed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q: When are these streams?<br>
                    A: Every <red>Tuesday</red> from <red>3:30PM EST</red> to <red>9:30PM EST</red>.
                    <br><br>
                    Q: Where Is Sign Up?<br>
                    A: A link to the Discord is posted at <red>10:00PM EST</red> the day <b>prior</b> to the stream.
                    <br><br>
                    Q: How does the application process work?<br>
                    A: After this link is posted, registrants are able to fill out a form in the server using a new
                    Discord feature called modals, which allow for in-app form popups.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q: Who is eligible?<br>
                    A: Anyone who is registered and <red>NOT</red> a bigot or terrible person is allowed,
                    as I have no control over who the bot picks :)

                    Q: Do you take commissions?<br>
                    A: I do, in fact, take commissions!
                    <br><br>
                    Q: How much do you charge per commission?<br>
                    A: The price differs per commission based on genre, complexity, etc. I will
                    usually estimate how much I think the amount of work is worth within a few
                    hours of receiving them, but it usually is between 100-300.
                    <br><br>
                    Q: Where can I commission you?<br>
                    A: You can commission me by inquiring either my Twitter or Discord DMs at any time!
                    I will respond as soon as I can :)
